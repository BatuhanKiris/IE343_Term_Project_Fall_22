Part 1 - Algorithm
1- Calculate popularity/duration for each song
2- Sort with a descending order of the value found in step 1
3- Add the top song in the list into the album if it has not been added yet.
4- If the song selected does not exceed the upper limit, go to step 3. If it exceeds, pass that song, and try to add the next available. If there is not suitable song left, stop.

Part 2 - Algorithm
Modified Nearest Neighborhood Algorithm with selecting maximum neighborhood values, like farthest neighborhood algorithm.
